#This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore a dataset about the microbes that live in human belly buttons. The dataset provides information about the different types of microbes found in the belly buttons of various individuals, showing that a few common types are found in most people, while others are rarer.

#Dashboard Features:
##Bar Chart: 
A chart that displays the top 10 most common microbes found in a person's belly button. It shows the relative abundance of each microbe.

##Bubble Chart: 
A chart that shows all the microbes for a person, with their size indicating how many of that microbe are present and their color representing different types of microbes.

##Personal Information: 
A section that displays demographic information about the person whose data is being viewed (such as age, gender, and ethnicity).

##Interactivity: 
The dashboard allows users to select different individuals from a list. When a new person is selected, the charts and personal information update to show data for that individual.

##Deployment: 
The project should be hosted online using a free service like GitHub Pages so that others can view and interact with the dashboard.

The goal of the project is to create an engaging, user-friendly tool to explore how the microbes in our belly buttons vary from person to person.# Operational-Taxonomic-Units-Analysis
